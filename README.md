# Rpi_IoT_Server

Developing an IoT Server that hosts a variety of different devices, usually consumes large amounts of energy and the cost of hardware (firmware/embedded systems and smart sensors) is overpriced. So, the idea of developing an IoT server with low budget and low power consumption was considered as a challenging task. The solution we developed for the term project of postgraduate Embedded Systems class of 2020, aims to alleviate this problem by using a low-power consumption Raspberry pi 4 as a server and an Arduino UNO with sensors. This is a low-cost hardware and software solution to monitor and store sensor data, but also control servos and motors from the local network and/or remotely via the internet. For our implementation we created a docker environment where containers such as MQTT, NodeRed, InfluxDB, Grafana, and Portainer were installed. These docker services run to our localhost environment and we expose them to the public internet by using a reverse proxy service called ngrok. Also, a remote Raspberry Pi client runs an application to handle file encryption, cloud service storage and heavyweight processes as well. Such processes are Computer Vision techniques and more precisely QR code detection and Edge detection that were established in this project.
